Sumary:
The text discusses the various subspaces that relate to a given transformation represented by a matrix A. The author highlights two important subspaces that every matrix has:
1. The set of vectors that get hit by the transformation, which is the x-axis in this case. This set includes all the vectors where $a_x = b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the elements of the matrix.
2. The set of vectors that do not get hit by the transformation, which includes all the vectors that are not on the x-axis.
The author emphasizes that these two subspaces are important to study in the context of transformations and linear algebra.

Summary:

The text discusses the various subspaces associated with a given transformation represented by a matrix A. The author highlights two crucial subspaces:
1. **Hit vectors**: The set of vectors that get hit by the transformation, which is the x-axis in this case. This set includes all the vectors where $a_x = b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the elements of the matrix.
2. **Non-hit vectors**: The set of vectors that do not get hit by the transformation, which includes all the vectors that are not on the x-axis.
The author stresses that these two subspaces are significant to analyze in the context of transformations and linear algebra.

Important words:

* **Hit vectors**: Vectors that get hit by the transformation.
* **Non-hit vectors**: Vectors that do not get hit by the transformation.
* **Transformation**: A matrix that represents a transformation.
* **Linear algebra**: The study of linear equations and their transformations.
